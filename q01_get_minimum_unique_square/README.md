# Get Minimum Unique Square

The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the size of the `arr` array. 
Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 <= i < n) contains a string in the form of two space-separated integers describing the respective values of ai and bi for an array. 


## Write a function `q01_get_minimum_unique_square` that takes: 

- Two variable and return an array of integers where each element i contains the number of square numbers in the inclusive interval [a1,bi]. This is printed to stdout by locked stub 
code in the editor. 
 
For example:
